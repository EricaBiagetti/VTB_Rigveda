# VTB_Rigveda
This repository contains the treebank employed for my PhD thesis on "R̥gvedic similes: a corpus-based study of their forms and functions".

The treebank contains 3997 sentences from the R̥gveda and is part of the bigger Vedic Treebank hosted by the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit (http://www.sanskrit-linguistics.org/dcs/index.php?contents=texte; Hellwig et al. 2020). The treebank is annotated according to the Universal Dependency scheme.
Among the annotated sentences are the 880 phrasal comparative constructions introduced by the particles na, iva, and yathā that I have analyzed in my thesis; furthermore, the treebank contains 20 clauses in which iva functions as an adaptor (discourse) and 87 comparative clauses introduced by yathā alone.
